MapleStory Mobile (MSM) is a mobile MMORPG inspired by the popular MMORPG, Maplestory, by Nexon. In essence, it's a game about gathering resources to enhance equipment and conquer challenging endgame content. To maximize resource accumulation, players often seek to optimize their gameplay. The introduction of the Auto-Battle (AB) system in MSM has provided a new opportunity for data-driven decision-making.

The EasyOCR library is well-suited for this task due to its simplicity. Our use case involves scanning screenshots of AB sessions to extract relevant statistics for analysis. Given the consistent nature of the screenshots, we anticipate minimal variation in extraction results.
