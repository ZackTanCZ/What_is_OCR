MapleStory Mobile (MSM) is a mobile MMORPG inspired by the popular MMORPG, Maplestory, by Nexon. In essence, it's a game about gathering resources to enhance equipment and conquer challenging endgame content. To maximize resource accumulation, players often seek to optimize their gameplay. The introduction of the Auto-Battle (AB) system in MSM has provided a new opportunity for data-driven decision-making.

The EasyOCR library is well-suited for this task due to its simplicity. Our use case involves scanning screenshots of AB sessions to extract relevant statistics for future analysis. Given the consistent nature of the screenshots, we anticipate minimal variation in extraction results.

Figure 1.0 - Example screenshot of a Auto-Battle session

*Note - The important statistics include _duration, kill count, meso gained, red meso gained and total exp gained_.

The EasyOCR library scans through each screenshot to extract the important statistics. Extra  measures are taken to validate and rectify erroneous extraction results. These results are then stored into dataframe for further data processing.

  <summary>Python libraries are used in our use case  </summary>
    EasyOCR, PLI, Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib, cv2, glob, scipy, scikit_posthoc

  <summary>The EasyOCR Library</summary>
  
The EasyOCR library is used to extract text from each screenshot. A _Reader_ object is first intialised into the variable '_reader_'. After which the image is parse into the _.readtext()_ function and the result is returned.  
  ```
  reader = easyocr.Reader(['en'], gpu = False)
  result = reader.readtext(image_path)
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>The CV2 Library</summary>
  
The CV2 library is used to visualise each extracted element of the image through the _.imread()_ function. Refer to Figure 1.1 for an example
  ```
  # Visualise each extracted element of the image using the function - checkImage
  img = cv2.imread(image_path,1)
  checked_img = checkImage(img, result)
  plt.imshow(checked_img)
  plt.show()
  
  # Save the image to the desktop
  plt.imsave('sample_image.jpg', checked_img)
  ```
</details>


<details>
  <summary>The glob Library</summary>
  
The glob library is used to perform pattern matching for files and directories. It provides a simple way to find files that matches a specific pattern.
  ```
list_of_image =  glob.glob(r'ab_*.jpg')
  ```

Using the above line of code, filenames starting with the prefix "ab_" are selected as Auto-Battle screenshots have a prefix of "ab_"

  <summary>Things to note</summary>
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/141135a9-f876-4aa9-b6d4-99ce034401dc">

  - Notice that the total exp figure extract is off by one digit. This has to be manually amended. One potential way to catch this error is through outlier dectection.

  ```
  duration = inner_list[0][1].replace(inner_list[0][1][-3],':')
  ```
  - In some cases, we observe that the duration statistic is invalid as the colon has been misread as a period by the EasyOCR library. To ensure the accuracy our result, the above line of code replaces the any punctuation found in the duration statistic with a colon. At the moment, these mistakes have to be manually fixed until a better solution is implemented.

  <summary>Statistical Functions (Scipy.stat)</summary>

  - Perform various parametric or non-parametric statistical tests (e.g. ANOVA, t-Test, kurskal-wallis H test)
    - Avoid violating strict assumptions to produce reliable results - Normality (Shapiro's Test) and Equality of Variance (Levene's Test)
    - Two approaches - Critical Value and P-Value (Prefered Approach)   
  - To test if there's an statistically significant difference between the mean/median of each group of samples
  - In our use case, it answers the question - Is there a difference in the hourly meso/exp rate between each different map?

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Posthoc Analysis (scikit-posthoc)</summary>

  - Perform various posthoc analysis (e.g. Dunn's Test, Dunnett's Test, Tukey HSD Test) following a parametric or non-parametric statistical tests
    - Doing pairwise comparison to determine the group of samples with higher mean
  - In our use case, it answers the question - which map has the higher hourly meso/exp rate?

# Analysis and Findings
<details>
  <summary>Assumption of Independence</summary>

  - This assumption should be consider during the design of experiment
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Test for Normality</summary>

  - [Shapiro-Wilk Test](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/prc/section2/prc213.htm) - Test for normality (if sample data came from a normally distributed population)
    - Null Hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>) - your data is from a normally distributed population
    - Alternate Hypothesis (H<sub>A</sub>) - your data is ***not*** from a normally distributed population
  - P-Value Approach
    - if the P-Value is lesser than alpha (0.05), H<sub>0</sub> ***is rejected*** and conclude that the data is ***not normally distributed***
    - else (P-Value >= alpha), H<sub>0</sub> ***is not rejected*** and conclude that the data is ***normally distributed***

<details>
  <summary>Test for Equal Variance</summary>

  - [Levene's Test](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda35a.htm) - Test for Equal Variance
    - Null Hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>) - ***Equal*** Variance
    - Alternate Hypothesis (H<sub>A</sub>) - At least one group has ***non-equal*** variance
  - P-Value Approach
    - if the P-Value is lesser than alpha (0.05), H<sub>0</sub> ***is rejected*** and conclude at least one group has ***non-equal variance***
    - else (P-Value >= alpha), H<sub>0</sub> ***is not rejected*** and conclude that each group has ***equal variance*** 

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Choice of Test</summary>

  - If both assumptions are met, we use ***parametric*** test (e.g.t-Test, ANOVA)
  - else, we use ***non-parametric*** test (e.g. X<super>2</super> test, Kruskal-Wallis Test, welch t-test)

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Testing of Two Groups</summary>

  - Used to compare the means between ***TWO*** groups
  - Two Sample Independent t-Test (parametric) & welch t-Test (Non-parametric)
  - SF144 vs. SF150 - Passed the check for Normality
    - Meso Group - Non-Equal Variance (use Welch t-Test)
      - Conclusion: Equal mean between groups (average meso/hr ***don't differ***)   
    - Exp Group - Equal Variance (use Two sample independent t-Test)
      - Conclusion: Non-Equal mean between groups (average xp/hr ***differs***) 
  - SF150 vs. SF158 - Passed Normality 
    - Meso Group - Equal Variance (use Two sample independent t-Test)
      - Conclusion: Non-Equal mean between groups (average meso/hr ***differs***) 
    - Exp Group -  Non-Equal Variance (use Welch t-Test)
      - Conclusion: Non-Equal mean between groups (average xp/hr ***differs***) 
  
  ðŸ’¡There is no need to compare SF144 vs. SF158 as it follows that SF158 is superior to SF150, which is superior to SF144
