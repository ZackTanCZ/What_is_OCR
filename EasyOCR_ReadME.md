MapleStory Mobile (MSM) is a mobile MMORPG, inspired by Maplestory the popular MMORPG by Nexon. In simpler terms,it is a game of gathering resource to get stronger items and conquer bosses. To this end, players should seek to accumulate the greatest amount of resource within the shortest period of time. With the introduction of the Auto-Battle (AB) system in MSM, players can take a data-driven approach to decide how to achieve their goal of accumulating resources.  

The EasyOCR library is suitable for this task as our use case is relatively simple. EasyOCR will only need to scan the screenshot(s) of each AB session to extract the relevent statistics for analysis. Each screenshot doesn't change much. Therefore, we should expect much variation in the extraction outcome.
