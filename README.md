Learning about ***O***ptical ***C***haracter ***R***ecognition (OCR) and possible use cases.

In simple terms, Optical Character Recognition is a piece of technology which extracts alphanumeric details (text, numbers) from image based documents (photos, screenshots or scanned documents). One potential use case relates to the data analytics process of gathering information for further processing, eliminating the labourious process of manually keying information into a container (e.g. Excel Spreasheet). While OCR has its perks, it also comes with its own set of challenges, which includes the following:

  1. Handwriting recognition - Recognizing handwritten text is more complex due to variations in handwriting styles and individual differences.
  2. Image quality -  Low-quality images or images with poor lighting can affect the accuracy of OCR.
  3. Language and font variations - OCR systems may struggle with recognizing text in different languages or fonts

To learn about OCR Technology and have some hands-on practice, various Python OCR libraries (each with varying levels of complexity) will be explored and applied to different use cases. These Python Libraries include:
1. [EasyOCR](https://jaided.ai/easyocr/tutorial/)
2. [Pyterrseract](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/)
