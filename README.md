OCR is a technology that transforms images (like photos, scans, or screenshots) containing text into editable digital text. This eliminates the tedious manual process of typing data from images.

Use Cases:
  1. Data Extraction: Quickly extract information from documents for analysis or storage.
  2. Document Digitization: Convert paper documents into digital formats for easier access and preservation.
  3. Form Processing: Automate the data entry process for forms, reducing errors and time.

Challenges:
  1. Handwriting Recognition: Variations in handwriting styles and individual differences make it challenging for OCR to accurately recognize handwritten text.
  2. Image Quality: Low-quality images or those with poor lighting can impact OCR accuracy.
  3. Language and Font Variations: OCR systems may struggle with recognizing text in different languages or fonts.

To learn more about OCR and gain practical experience, we'll explore popular Python libraries:

  1. [EasyOCR](https://jaided.ai/easyocr/tutorial/): A user-friendly library with pre-trained models for various languages.
  2. [Pytesseract](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/): A powerful library that integrates with Tesseract OCR engine, offering high accuracy but requiring more setup.
